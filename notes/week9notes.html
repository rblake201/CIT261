Week 9 notes<br><br>

The Window Object<br><br>

Browser Object Model(BOM)<br>
Any global variable is a property of the BOM<br><br>

alert() , confirm() and prompt()<br>
The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. <br>
The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that<br>
shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.<br>
The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message<br>
provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text.<br><br>

The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current<br>
browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API.<br>
The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.<br>
The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page:<br>
There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate forwards<br>
and backwards by one page respectively, just like using the browserâ€™s forward and back buttons.<br><br>

HTML5 API<br><br>

The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation,<br>
and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new<br>
features that appear in the latest devices.<br>
