The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:<br>
transform: translate(45px, -45px);<br><br>

Scale: The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically<br>
transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);<br><br>

Transitions and animations are possible with css<br><br>

Canvas: With HTML5â€™s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of<br>
our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text,<br>
gradients and patterns
