Week 5 notes <br><br>

Exceptions: An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.<br>
Warnings are errors that don't cause the code to crash.<br><br>

We can strict mode to determine problems with our code<br><br>

The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops
a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of
variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.<br><br>

Console debugging, console.log(), ect. <br><br>

There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:<br><br>

 EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify<br>
 errors when using the global eval() function.<br><br>

 RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.<br><br>

 ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.<br><br>

 SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.<br><br>

 TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.<br><br>

 URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.<br><br>

 InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much<br>
 recursion.<br><br>
 
Try catch blocks to handle exceptions<br><br>
