Week 7 notes:<br><br>

Call method:<br>
function sayHello(){<br>
    return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;<br>
}<br><br>

const clark = { name: 'Clark' };<br>
const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };<br>
sayHello.call(clark);<br>
<< 'Hello, my name is Clarke'<br>
sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
<< 'Hello, my name is Bruce'<br><br>

Cache can store results of arguments to be more effecient<br>
For example: square(3) << 9<br>
             square.cache; << {"3", 9}<br><br>
             
AnImmediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is<br>
invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember<br>
we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole<br>
declaration inside parentheses, as in this example:<br><br>

(function(){<br>
const temp = 'World';<br>
console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br>
})();<br>
<< 'Hello World'<br><br>

Recursive functions: similar to a loop
